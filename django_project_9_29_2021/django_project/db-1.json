The museum on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., offers exhibition galleries and spaces for performances, lectures and symposia, research, and education. The George Gustav Heye Center (GGHC) in New York City houses exhibitions, research, educational activities, and performing arts programs. The Cultural Resources Center (CRC) in Suitland, Maryland, houses the museum's collections as well as the conservation, repatriation, and digital imaging programs, and research facilities. The NMAI's off-site outreach efforts, often referred to as the \"fourth museum,\" include websites, traveling exhibitions, and community programs.\r\n\r\nSince the passage of its enabling legislation in 1989 (amended in 1996), the NMAI has been steadfastly committed to bringing Native voices to what the museum writes and presents, whether on-site at one of the three NMAI venues, through the museum's publications, or via the Internet. The NMAI is also dedicated to acting as a resource for the hemisphere's Native communities and to serving the greater public as an honest and thoughtful conduit to Native cultures—present and past—in all their richness, depth, and diversity.", "isPerson": false, "cover_image": "cover_images/pori/nmai.jpg", "address": "Fourth Street & Independence Ave., S.W.

Calhoun on March 11, 1824, to oversee and carry out the Federal government's trade and treaty relations with the tribes. Congress gave the BIA statutory authority by the act of July 9, 1832 (4 Stat. 564, chap. 174). In 1849, the BIA was transferred to the newly created U.S. Department of the Interior. For years thereafter, the Bureau was known variously as the Indian office, the Indian bureau, the Indian department, and the Indian Service. The Interior Department formally adopted the name “Bureau of Indian Affairs” for the agency on September 17, 1947.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs, Division of Extension and Industry was created to document Indian economic activities and ways of life, and the work of the extension agents.

Where a person would go to fast and pray without food or water for days at a time or until they received a vision, usually with a song.  WIth the coming of Christianity, this tradition became the source of many Crow hymns.  So the tune and the words expressed all were deeply embedded in Absalooke language, ways of thinking, and music.\r\n\r\nThe women allowed to be religious leaders in 19203-1930s.\r\n\r\nDave Graber knows when one song ends and another one begins, so he is able to splice the reel-to-reel into individual songs.", "access_notes_or_rights_and_reproduction": "", "geographical_location": "Crow Reservation, MT", "location_of_originals": "24 reel to reel recordings are stored at the Little Big Horn College Archives.

They shared the same landscape and sense of heritage – one the Crow and the other the white guy -- with no distance between them. The conversations extended from events of the day, to well-known tales of characters on the landscape, to recitations of traditional Crow or Irish legends. Dale could speak a little Crow language.

Both gave Wellknown Buffalo\r\n permission to fulfill her vision to re-acquaint the Crow Indian community with items that had\r\n long-ago been removed from the reservation. Chairman Nomee specifically gave Wellknown Buffalo\r\nwritten permission to access Crow Indian collections at the Smithsonian Institution’s National\r\nMuseum of American Indian (NMAI) in 2001.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Susie Kelly helped Wellknown Buffalo recruit and arrange for Crow elders Tilton Tall Bull and\r\nClayton Mountain Picket to visit the NMAI in Washington, DC. To paraphrase Wellknown Buffalo:\r\nThe mission was for those people to come forward with knowledge about the cultural items. Our\r\nbundles are dying, because almost no one is left with knowledge about them.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly and Wellknown Buffalo led seven trips to the NMAI between 2001 and 2008. Kelly and\r\nWellknown Buffalo videotaped Old Bull and Mountain Picket as they examined and described the\r\nhistory and stories about the sacred and non-sacred items there. Wellknown said, “The bundles\r\nwanted to breathe. I prayed over each bundle and asked it permission to be opened.”</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor ten years, the videotapes of the elders’ encounters with the items stored at the national\r\nmuseum sat at The Center Pole compound without seeing the light of day. Wellknown Buffalo and\r\nKelly were concerned that Wellknown Buffalo’s vision would not come to fruition.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In the summer of 2018, University of Delaware Professor Cindy Ott visited her friends at The\r\nCenter Pole and happened to ask Wellknown Buffalo and Kelly if there was a material culture\r\nproject that Ott and her students could help them with. It was a fortuitous question that led to\r\nthe creation of the Crow Indian Virtual Archive and Museum. Wellknown Buffalo gave Ott\r\npermission to create CIVAM because, she said, Ott is an educator. Wellknown Buffalo and Kelly\r\nwere relieved that the items would no longer be in storage, but would be “used to educate\r\nothers, to open up minds to what happened in our past. I would love to have my\r\ngreat-great-granddaughter learn about them in school. Lots of stories are now lost. This is for\r\nthe future of our children. That is why this is important to me,” Wellknown Buffalo said.</p>\r\n<p>The CIVAM is maintained by students, staff, and faculty at the University of Delaware Departments\r\nof History, Museum Studies, and Computer Science with support from the UNIDEL Foundation and in\r\ncollaboration with The Center Pole on the Crow reservation in Montana.
