The NMAI cares for one of the world's most expansive collections of Native artifacts, including objects, photographs, archives, and media covering the entire Western Hemisphere, from the Arctic Circle to Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n The National Museum of the American Indian operates three facilities. The museum on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., offers exhibition galleries and spaces for performances, lectures and symposia, research, and education. The George Gustav Heye Center (GGHC) in New York City houses exhibitions, research, educational activities, and performing arts programs. The Cultural Resources Center (CRC) in Suitland, Maryland, houses the museum's collections as well as the conservation, repatriation, and digital imaging programs, and research facilities. The NMAI's off-site outreach efforts, often referred to as the \"fourth museum,\" include websites, traveling exhibitions, and community programs.\r\n\r\nSince the passage of its enabling legislation in 1989 (amended in 1996), the NMAI has been steadfastly committed to bringing Native voices to what the museum writes and presents, whether on-site at one of the three NMAI venues, through the museum's publications, or via the Internet. The NMAI is also dedicated to acting as a resource for the hemisphere's Native communities and to serving the greater public as an honest and thoughtful conduit to Native cultures\u2014present and past\u2014in all their richness, depth, and diversity.",

Yellowtail lived around the West and held powerful positions in government, yet ranch life on the reservation has always been home to him. Yellowtail took the photographs with a variety of cameras, using mostly slide color film.  Subjects include ranch activities, such as cattle drives, cow camps, and round-ups. His photographs also depict his family members and their Indian and non-Indian neighbors at work and at play.",

The photographs date from the 1930s and depict Crow Indian adults and youth in agricultural pursuits, 4-H programs, gardening, home economic activities, and in social gatherings. They are seen at feeds (feasts), working in their gardens, harvesting their farm fields, and managing livestock, among other activities.

Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution describes Congress's powers over Indian affairs: \"To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.\" The BIA, one of the oldest bureaus in the Federal government, was administratively established by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun on March 11, 1824, to oversee and carry out the Federal government's trade and treaty relations with the tribes. Congress gave the BIA statutory authority by the act of July 9, 1832 (4 Stat. 564, chap. 174). In 1849, the BIA was transferred to the newly created U.S. Department of the Interior. For years thereafter, the Bureau was known variously as the Indian office, the Indian bureau, the Indian department, and the Indian Service. The Interior Department formally adopted the name \u201cBureau of Indian Affairs\u201d for the agency on September 17, 1947.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs, Division of Extension and Industry was created to document Indian economic activities and ways of life, and the work of the extension agents. Charles S. Runyan was the extension agent who produced the reports under the the supervision of Crow Superintendent Robert Yellowtail in the 1930s.",

A Crow linguist began recording on cassette tapes in early 1970s.\r\n\r\n\r\n1997 went from reel to reel to mini-disks.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, a committee of Crow people concerned about preserving the tradition sponsored the recording sessions and the Crow Hymns Project was organized.  They included David Graber, Georgine Falls Down, Sampson Bird in Ground,  Debbie Yarlott, Larry and Gwen Plain Bull, Joseph and Gloria Medicine Crow, David Turns Plenty, Mabel...\r\n\r\nA Montana Humanities grant was awarded with the support of Dr. Janine Pease, then founder and president of Little Big Horn College, in 1989.",

They continued to seek the creator's wisdom in prayer and fasting at locations in the mountians identified with family fasting and praying locations.  Where a person would go to fast and pray without food or water for days at a time or until they received a vision, usually with a song.  WIth the coming of Christianity, this tradition became the source of many Crow hymns.  So the tune and the words expressed all were deeply embedded in Absalooke language, ways of thinking, and music.\r\n\r\nThe women allowed to be religious leaders in 19203-1930s.\r\n\r\nDave Graber knows when one song ends and another one begins, so he is able to splice the reel-to-reel into individual songs.",

Most of the hats are reservation hats, a type of elongated cowboy hat, which was popular among Plains Indians around this time.\r\n\r\nThe tipis from this era had canvas covers, instead of buffalo hide. Traditionally, Crow families used the four-pole foundation. Poles could be twenty-feet in length.",

One boy (to the top left) is wearing a reservation hat, while the boy kneeling in front of him is wearing a fedora. Some of the boys are holding up a paper sign, though the writing is not visible. To the left of the group is a dirt road and a line of trees. A wooden building stands on the other side of the dirt road. In the distance, behind the line of trees, is a house.",

Here, when I was a teenager, I gathered meat from a new kill. Hunting for food sustenance has long been an annual task and remains so today. Sport hunters usually regard the antlers of an elk as a trophy, but traditional Crows are disdainful of the practice. Accordingly, the antlers in this photograph were left in the field, while every bit of usable meat was collected.  (July 16, 2020)",

This campsite in the Bighorn Mountains has been in use for more than a century by stockmen tending cattle on the associated Crow Tribal grazing permit. Being adjacent to their private grazing allotments, the permit has been held by Yellowtails for almost all of that time. One or more cowboys occupy the camp and look after the cattle. I spent every summer of my youth living in that camp. Note that the tent is tattered by a marauding black bear. \r\n\r\nMy parents Jane Powers and Bill Yellowtail met as young cowhands and eloped to marry in 1943 because her family objected to the relationship between a white woman and a Crow man. Ironically, marriages between white men and Indian women had been commonplace for more than a century.",

Bill Yellowtail Sr. and Dale Gibson were life-long neighbors on their adjoining ranches on the Crow Reservation. They enjoyed nothing more than telling and retelling stories by a campfire with a boiled pot of stout coffee. They shared the same landscape and sense of heritage \u2013 one the Crow and the other the white guy -- with no distance between them. The conversations extended from events of the day, to well-known tales of characters on the landscape, to recitations of traditional Crow or Irish legends. Dale could speak a little Crow language. With skills honed over lifetimes of these sessions, both cowboys and Indians treasure a singular ability to transform a mundane event into a hilarious story. Teasing is a high art. The smart young person will practice good listening and respectful quietude. Just keep the coffee cups full.",

Both gave Wellknown Buffalo\r\n permission to fulfill her vision to re-acquaint the Crow Indian community with items that had\r\n long-ago been removed from the reservation. Chairman Nomee specifically gave Wellknown Buffalo\r\nwritten permission to access Crow Indian collections at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National\r\nMuseum of American Indian (NMAI) in 2001.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Susie Kelly helped Wellknown Buffalo recruit and arrange for Crow elders Tilton Tall Bull and\r\nClayton Mountain Picket to visit the NMAI in Washington, DC. To paraphrase Wellknown Buffalo:\r\nThe mission was for those people to come forward with knowledge about the cultural items. Our\r\nbundles are dying, because almost no one is left with knowledge about them.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly and Wellknown Buffalo led seven trips to the NMAI between 2001 and 2008. Kelly and\r\nWellknown Buffalo videotaped Old Bull and Mountain Picket as they examined and described the\r\nhistory and stories about the sacred and non-sacred items there. Wellknown said, \u201cThe bundles\r\nwanted to breathe. I prayed over each bundle and asked it permission to be opened.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor ten years, the videotapes of the elders\u2019 encounters with the items stored at the national\r\nmuseum sat at The Center Pole compound without seeing the light of day. Wellknown Buffalo and\r\nKelly were concerned that Wellknown Buffalo\u2019s vision would not come to fruition.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In the summer of 2018, University of Delaware Professor Cindy Ott visited her friends at The\r\nCenter Pole and happened to ask Wellknown Buffalo and Kelly if there was a material culture\r\nproject that Ott and her students could help them with. It was a fortuitous question that led to\r\nthe creation of the Crow Indian Virtual Archive and Museum. Wellknown Buffalo gave Ott\r\npermission to create CIVAM because, she said, Ott is an educator. Wellknown Buffalo and Kelly\r\nwere relieved that the items would no longer be in storage, but would be \u201cused to educate\r\nothers, to open up minds to what happened in our past. I would love to have my\r\ngreat-great-granddaughter learn about them in school. Lots of stories are now lost. This is for\r\nthe future of our children. That is why this is important to me,\u201d Wellknown Buffalo said.</p>\r\n<p>The CIVAM is maintained by students, staff, and faculty at the University of Delaware Departments\r\nof History, Museum Studies, and Computer Science with support from the UNIDEL Foundation and in\r\ncollaboration with The Center Pole on the Crow reservation in Montana.
